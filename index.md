## TL;DR
Educated in several acronyms across Italy (UNITN, UNIMIB), I am now working as AI Engineer at [Glassform.ai](https://www.glassform.ai/), applying Artificial Intelligence in the optimizaiton of the hollow glass production.

I previously worked as an AI consultant at [spindoxlabs](https://spindoxlabs.com/en/), the R&D lab of [SPINDOX](https://makeamark.spindox.it/en/spindox-make-a-mark/) which is focused on innovative projects in the automotive field.

Throughout my career, I was interested in different fields which had AI in common; For my master thesis, I worked with the university of [Milano Bicocca](https://ikr3.disco.unimib.it/) on a publication about measuring the psychological distress through blog contents in the COVID19 era.
I've also been involved with [Istituto Dalle Molle di Studi sull'Intelligenza Artificiale](https://www.supsi.ch/idsia) on evaluating and grounding the response of LLM in critical domains, and I worked in multiple occasions with [FBK](https://www.fbk.eu/en/), in projects that ranges from computer vision to data engineering platforms.

### Research 
I have done research in a heterogenus set of topics: NLP on mental health domain ([CMB](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/50F75572DF5C8F749B7B57DA0DB8490B/S0924933821000031a.pdf/surveilling-covid-19-emotional-contagion-on-twitter-by-sentiment-analysis.pdf), [SD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X21002399)), AI and Large Language Models assessment [IDSIA](https://ipg.idsia.ch/preprints/mitrovic2024e.pdf) and industry optimization [PCS](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=57geT9MAAAAJ&citation_for_view=57geT9MAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC)
